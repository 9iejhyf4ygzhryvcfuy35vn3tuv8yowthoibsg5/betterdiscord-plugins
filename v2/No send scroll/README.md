This is simple plugin which disables scroll to bottom on sending message

## Installation

Likely you are using stable BetterDiscord version v1 (v0.2.81:**1.xxx**), so see [this instructions](../../v1#installation). You will need to download and install [`no_send_scroll.plugin.js`](https://betterdiscord.net/ghdl?url=https://github.com/samogot/betterdiscord-plugins/blob/master/v1/no_send_scroll.plugin.js) and [`1lib_discord_internals.plugin.js`](https://betterdiscord.net/ghdl?url=https://github.com/samogot/betterdiscord-plugins/blob/master/v1/1lib_discord_internals.plugin.js) files. If you are on windows - just run them.

This plugin also supports alpha BetterDiscord version v2 for developers only. If you one of them, you do not need any instruction, but still there is [one](../README.md#installation).

This plugin depends on [Lib Discord Internals](../1Lib%20Discord%20Internals) so install it too!
